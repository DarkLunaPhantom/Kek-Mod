Normal pitboss cannot be used with this version, instead you need the PB Mod version available at https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/mod-for-pitboss-games.533346/ or https://github.com/YggdrasiI/PBStats. Be sure to check all the other nice stuff they've got there, some of their things will surely be interesting to any pitboss host.
