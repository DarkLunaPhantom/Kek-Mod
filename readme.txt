Source code and commit log: https://github.com/DarkLunaPhantom/Civ4-K-Mod

Current version: v0.25b (based on K-Mod v1.46)
Date: 06/Oct/2020

Starting from v0.25, the mod can be updated to the current version in-game via Advanced -> Options -> Update Mod (as long as the update server is online).

Normal pitboss cannot be used with this version, instead you need the PB Mod version available at https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/mod-for-pitboss-games.533346/ or https://github.com/YggdrasiI/PBStats. Be sure to check all the other nice stuff they've got there, some of their things will surely be interesting to any pitboss host.
