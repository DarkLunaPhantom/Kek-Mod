Current version: 0.3.1 (based on K-Mod v1.46)
Date: 2024-10-01

Starting from version 0.3.0, the mod can be updated to the current version in-game via Advanced -> Options -> Update Mod (as long as the update server is online).
Multiplayer executables inside Beyond the Sword folder cannot be updated in this manner.

Normal pitboss cannot be used with this version, instead you need the PB Mod version available at https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/mod-for-pitboss-games.533346/ or https://github.com/YggdrasiI/PBStats. Be sure to check all the other nice stuff they've got there, some of their things will surely be interesting to any pitboss host.
