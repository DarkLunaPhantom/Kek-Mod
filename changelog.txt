v0.23 - 18/Mar/2019 - (based on K-Mod v1.46)

    Merged some components of PBMod_v8 by Ramkhamhaeng and Zulan:
        Previously merged PBMod_v7, so those things were updated.

        Increased victory conditions for teams with more than 1 member: now they need more cities and parts for cultural and space victories.
        Changed espionage costs for teams. Now they scale similarly like research. Idea for the formula by Fran.
    Changed how war declarations that cause other war declarations work. They used to be nested, but now they are queued so that they trigger defensive pacts and everything else in the correct order.
    Changed how unit type for draft is selected. Conscription value is not used anymore. Unit type is selected on the basis of strength and having certain combat abilities (i.e. having the ability to attack, to get defensive bonuses, etc.)
    When given independence, colony doesn't get free units of draft unit type anymore, but gets best available defenders like in other similar cases (free defenders of barbarian cities and culture flipped cities).
    Changed how maximum distance is calculated to make maintenance more reasonable for toroidal maps, idea from Tides of War by SevenSpirits.
    Barbarians now need to have reveal tech for resources to be able to build units that require them.
    Included OOSLogger, idea from Fall from Heaven 2 by Kael.
    If a city will be autorazed on conquest, it has * next to population number.

        Lighter player color over water on the minimap.
        Some other bugfixes.
    Some changes to advanced start:
        Handicap for advanced start points is now only applied to the AI. Modifiers were changed to compensate. This way human players always get the number that is visible in the game setup.
        Starting gold and free handicap techs are not given in advanced start.
        Barbarians get starting research progress dependent on what do other players get in advanced start.

    Removed C2C minimize AI turn time option.
    Fixed a bug in culture removal after city destruction.

    Fixed an error in reimplementation of random leader/civ selection.
    Fixed a bug (I introduced) where nuking a non-combat unit could crash the game.


v0.20 - 02/Jun/2018 - (based on K-Mod v1.46)
WARNING: This breaks savegame compatibility.

    Provided only one dll which supports 48 civs (and the code on GitHub also says 48 now).
    Included all karadoc's changes up to v1.46.
    Set to use PB Mod_v7 PitBoss. (v7 Python PBStats files required.)
    Colonies cannot reuse player slots as this caused bugs. They also don't inherit espionage points from parent civ anymore. (But they do inherit EspionagePointsEver.)
    Capital cannot be moved while spaceship is underway.
    Improved AI evaluation of SDI and Bomb Shelters. (AI thought that Bomb Shelters were completely worthless before.)
    Fixed Bomb Shelter effect for non-combat units. (It used to decrease the chance of death by nuke to 2-3%, now it results in 39.5% chance.)
    Moved the code for building missiles for missile carriers out of the assault case (as K-Mod did for building planes for aircraft carriers). Fixed a bug regarding the number of needed missiles.
    First AI city in a new area is not necessarily on the coast anymore.
    Changes to game options:
        Hidden game options are always set to their default value.
        Added Unlimited Permanent Alliances game option. It removes the (2 member) limit on team size for permanent alliances.
        Fixed bug with Unrestricted Leaders game option caused by the exe having that option hardcoded in the 8th position. (Had to reimplement the random assignment of leaders/civs, idea for solution came from Fall from Heaven 2 by Kael.)
        Added Advanced Settlers game options where settler era changes as the game progresses (where settler era is the minimum of player era and game era where game era is changed from rounding down the average to rounding the average).
    Some adjustments to city ownership changes and city razing:
        National (and team) wonders are destroyed when changing owners.
        City spot doesn't disappear from everyone's map (and some culture coverage is also updated on everyone's map).
        Disabled code for restoring floodplains when riverside desert city is destroyed.
        Razing a city erases most of the plot culture it generated.
        Trading a city transfers all owner's city culture and most of the plot culture the city generated for the owner.
        Fixed a bug (?) where vassals would get free units in liberated cities.
        City transfers by diplomatic votes leave owner's culture intact.
        Cities cannot culture flip from master to vassal.
    Changed and fixed some things with UN/AP resolutions:
        Fixed inconsistencies with conditions for ability to propose and defy.
        War resolutions can be called against voting members.
        Defensive pacts are properly cancelled before war resolution takes effect.
        Vassals cannot defy resolutions.
        Players can defy resolutions assigning them a city.

        When a civilization is destroyed, all of its culture becomes barbarian.
        Barbarian culture is shown on minimap and in the globe view.
        Barbarians' unit support costs set to 0.
        Barbarians affected by the same handicap modifiers (production costs, growth thresholds, war weariness and financial costs) as the rest of AI players.
        Barbarians can now only spawn on tiles which produce food (and on sea only adjacent to land tiles with food) and the chance is higher if adjacent tiles produce more food.
        Bugfix for creating barbarian cities (they used to get random location on empty landmasses) from AdvCiv by f1rpo.
        Barbarian cities with Raging Barbarians game option start with a worker.
        Enabled barbarian spawns in all eras.
        Disabled BBAI limit for spawning of sea barbarians.
    Imperialistic settler cost reduction also applied in Advanced Start when purchasing cities.
    Removed extra (free) food when purchasing population points in Advanced Start.
    Fixed detection when the AI should do advanced start in simultaneous turns game.
    Cities on different landmasses also have to be two tiles apart.
    Fixed a bug in unit gifting restrictions.
    Fixed the color of unknown players in project list.
    Average handicap is calculated by rounding instead of rounding down.
    Gifted units cannot move for 2 turns.

    Added game era to era display in BUG Mod.
    Adjusted project AI to changes I made previously.
    Added verification of state religion.
    Production overflow now supports mods with multiple buildings of the same type in a city, from Final Frontier Plus by TC01, T-hawk.
    Minor spelling, comment and other adjustments.

    Unused nuclear plants cannot trigger meltdown. (E.g. nuclear plant in a city with hydro plant.)
    Multiple changes to barbarians:
        They can build all normal land and sea military units. Only units with appropriate unit AI type supported can be spawned.
        Blocked additional special units just for consistency. (Spies etc.)
        Barbarians can build and upgrade units without resources, they need just revealing and enabling technologies for required resources.
        Barbarians can upgrade units outside their territory (with limitations similar to spawn limitations.)
        Barbarians can now hurry production in their cities.
        Barbarians don't value commerce when building improvements, working plots and picking specialists.
        They don't value GPP when picking specialists.
        Adjusted the list of buildings available to barbarians. (Included culture buildings and excluded gold/commerce buildings.)

    Changed starting espionage weight from 1 to 0.
    Sorted votesources in victory screen alphabetically.
    Team members don't block each other from building wonders and projects.
    Sorted buildings in Sevopedia without taking "the" into account.

    Restricted and fixed unit gifting:
        Fixed bug in AI evaluation of received unit.

        Receiving player must have prerequisite techs for both the unit and resources required for the unit.
    Reworked fallout feature to enable AI to understand it and scrub it efficiently: fallout is now treated like jungle/forest, i.e. improvements can be built on it and building them removes fallout.
    Fixed bug related to minimum yield required for building improvements and removable features that lower yields.
    Glance screen with restricted leaders now always shows all rows.
    Human vassals are now forced to vote for their master unless they are also one of the candidates. (Just like the AI.)

    Fixed founding year display for AI cities built in advanced start with simultaneous turns.
    Fixed various minor bugs I introduced previously.
    Various adjustments to (my previous) comments and style.


v0.04 - 26/May/2016 - (based on K-Mod v1.44b)

    Included all additional post-v1.44b karadoc's changes from K-Mod github:
        Lots of tweaks, bugfixes and various improvements.
        Inflated costs displayed everywhere and inflation depends on global tech state (with player's own techs having higher weight).
        Decreased chance of spies being caught while exploring friendly lands.
        Implemented SpecialistExtraCommerce xml field for techs (but none of the techs actually use it currently).
    Included most of alberts2's changes up to this date (excluding karadoc's experimental balance changes):
        Lots of bugfixes.
        Minimize AI turn time option from C2C.

    Applied Ramkhamhaeng's patch for missing/duplicate language tags.

    Blocked players who have vassals from becoming peace vassals (to block them frome releasing their vassals for no good reason.)
    Added some functionality to foreign advisor to enable normal usage with high number of civilizations on map. (Now your own leaderhead in Relations tab is an on/off button which causes that only (shift) selected leaderheads are shown in Relations and Glance tab.)
    Disabled gifting foreign religion missionaries to theocracies (actually whenever non-state religion cannot spread to that player) to block religion spreading exploit. Also disabled gifting transports if you cannot gift all cargo (to avoid weird situations of having your units in foreign transports).

    Added 48 players dll in addition to the standard 18 players one.

    Tweaked trade screen unpause bugfix text and button location a bit.


v0.01 - 28/Feb/2016 - (based on K-Mod v1.44b)

    Merged with PB Mod_v5. All web interface features should work. Applied pause/trade screen bugfix and few other minor bugfixes. All credit goes to the creators of PB Mod.
    Enemy units present in city are no longer deleted when city flips, they are just bumped out of enemy borders.
